            <p>Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, and the process include four basic steps:
            raw coffee beans must be<a href="roasting.html"> roasted </a>,the roasted coffee beans must then be<a href="grinding.html"> ground</a>,the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time(<a href="brewing.html">brewed</a>) and finally the liquid coffee must be seperated from the used grounds.
            </p>
           <p>Coffee is usually brewed imediately before drinking. In most areas coffee may be purchased unprocessed,or already roasted, aor already roasted and ground.Coffee is often vacum packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.
